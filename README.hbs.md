Are you building a hook or functional React component that needs to predictably clear and/or hydrate memoized values in an easy-to-use way? Opportunities are almost endless; no matter if you're subscribing to external state, initializing timers or intervals, or creating a new instance of some object every time deps change that eventually needs to be deconstructed, `useClearedMemo` will be there for you to do the job.
