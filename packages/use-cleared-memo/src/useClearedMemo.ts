import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef } from 'react';

/**
 * Allows for clearing a memoized value when dependencies change as well as on unmount. The code
 * below is a simplified version of the functionality, which omits the critical fact that the
 * *every value that has been retrieved will be cleared before the next one is retrieved **or** when the component unmounts*.
 * That means every retrieved value will be cleared, and only once. The most obvious use-case for this is creating subscriptions,
 * which either just needs to get unsubscribed on unmount or hydrated when a new subscription should be created (based on the deps).
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  React.useMemo(() => {
 *    clearFn(value);
 *    return getFn();
 *  }, deps);
 * + React.useEffect(() => clearFn, deps);
 * â‰ˆ useClearedMemo(getFn, clearFn, deps);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {function(): T} getFn - Returns the memoized value that is to be cleared.
 * @param {function(T): void} clearFn - Clears the previously memoized value when the component unmounts or the deps change.
 * @param {ReadonlyArray} deps - Identities that the `getFn` depends on. When changed, the previously memoized value will be cleared and the `getFn` will be called to retrieve the new value.
 * @param {ReadonlyArray} clearFnDeps - Identities that the `clearFn` depends on.
 * @returns {T}
 * @template T

       * In some cases, the effect cleanup function will be called even though the component is not truly unmounted, but to perform updates.
       * That is, the value is cleared, but is not retrieved again as the React.useMemo is not updated. In short, we have a cleared value that is still in use in some cases.
       * We solve this by checking if the value has been cleared when mounting the component, which means the effect cleanup function was called just before performing the effect again.
       *
       * The obvious problem here is that even though a new value is assigned, it is not returned from the hook. Instead, we get a sort of "useClearedValueEffect" functionality.
       * I have not found a good solution to this, so it will just have to be a problem that one might have to deal with in other places. For instance, to perform component updates in the
       * "getFn" in the cases where necessary. As a relief, though, the most useful and therefore important part of `useClearedMemo` is actually
       * clearing the value, so maybe this isn't that big of a deal.
